# Atmospheric Error Reduction Algorithm
 This script filters error from on-earth telescopes and produces plots in matplotlib. The data the I used came from the DSOC telescope in West Texas.
 
 The script's input, is a dataset of star names, coordinates, magnitudes, and observation times in Modified Julian Date (MJD) which is organized and separated by observation time. A set of observations with the same observation time is called a 'frame' in the code.
